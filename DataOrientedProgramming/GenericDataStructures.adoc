= Represent data with Generic Data structures

Use [map, list, vector] not classes

Benefits

* Can use generic functions (Better to have 100 functions on 1 data structures)
* Flexible data

== Generic functions

* clojure core functions (select-keys, partition, cycle)
* lodash

== Flexible data model

If we wanted to add a Fullname property to the data
* Static OOP -> Create new class AuthorWithFullname
* Dynamic FP -> `(assoc author :fullname "Alice Wonderland")` 

== Cons

* Performance hit
* Data shape has to be documented manually
* No compile time checks
** Type system only stops smaller errors, Tests solve most of it.
