= 4 pillars of good unit test

. Regressions
. Resistance to Refactor
. Fast feedback
. Maintainability

== Regressions

Needed to maintain growth of project.

* Making sure you don't break old stuff when making changes
* Test Domain logic more as it's more valuable
** Waste of time testing getters and setters

== Resistance to refactor
Use classical style testing as only testing the output and not concerned with the implementation so the implementation should be able to change and not break the tests

False positive :: 
Test fails even though implementation is correct

London style leads to false positives as you have to fix the tests as you refactor as you are testing the implementation which leads to Loss of interest/confidence it tests so that you end up not run your tests or refactoring
