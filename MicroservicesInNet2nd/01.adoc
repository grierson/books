== Main Characteristics
* Responsible for a single capability
** "Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons."
** Business capability
*** DDD: Bounded Context
** Technical capability
*** When many microservices need the same technical capability. (Auth, Alert)
* Can be deployed on its own, independently
** Can deploy a single service (business capability) without impacting others
** Whereas with monolith you have to deploy the entire system again
* Consists of 1 or many capabilities
* Runs in its own separate process
* Has its own dedicated data store
** Doesn't directly access another microservice datastore
* Collaborates with other microservices to complete its own action
* A small team can maintain a few handfuls of microservices
* A microservice is replaceable (Rewrite in 2 weeks)

== Communication between Microservices
* Queues
* Service bus
* gRPC
* GraphQL
* HTTP

== Benefits

* Can be developed, modified, and deployed quickly so that you can be quick to market
* Single capability so microservices are much smaller so are easier to understand and maintain
* Services are independently scalable
** Need lots of instances of the `Product search microservice` but only a few for the `Complaints microservice`. With monoliths, you would have to deploy the whole system just to scale the `Product search` capability.
** Saves on running costs
* Can pick right tool for the job
** Use Redis for shopping cart microservice
** Use SQL for product information microservice

== Cons

* Communicating between services
* Manage many deployments of many services and their different environments
