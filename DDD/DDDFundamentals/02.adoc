* Developers are a problem solver not code monkeys
* Design for the problem not your tools
* DDD Tackles business complexity not technical complexity
* Solving problems, not just coding
* Break problems down

[quote, Theodore Levitt]
People donâ€™t want quarter-inch drill bits. They want quarter-inch holes.

People want to fix a problem, they don't care about the solution

* Focus on a single `Sub domain` at a time
** Divide and conquer
* Focus on how you are going to design your solution not the design implementation
