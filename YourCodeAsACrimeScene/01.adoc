= Chapter 1

Spend most time/money/effort with code maintenance because development is a learning experience. (40-80% project cost) for example.

* Users suggest improvements (Integrating new features)
* Growth of product (Scale/performance)
* Working with problematic code (Oversight of implementation)

So being able to understand codebase is most important. So we need to

* Find code with most defects
* Find code that matters most for evolution
* Find code with steepest learning curve
* How team influence code base
* Track organisational problems
* Leave trace of our changes for future maintenance
