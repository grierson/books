# Competing With Unicorns

## Unicorn

You know you have perfect product market fit when:

- You can’t make your product fast enough.
- Usage is growing faster than your ability to add servers.
- Money starts pouring in faster than you can spend it.
- You can’t hire fast enough to keep up with demand.

## Iterate

Continously applying scientific method and having a discovery mindset. Enables
to demo value by showing traction and then calibrate to customer need.

> Building product means validating unknowns, getting product in front of
> customers, and then iterating on it

That means periodically doing the same story multiple times, each time
collecting more data, through which comes better insight—and then ultimately
triangulating toward a better solution. All things enterprises typically don’t
do when executing through a project.

## Mission

Instead of using people for their backs, missions engage people for their
brains. makes work meaningful

Projects are the wrong vehicle for building new product. They lack the
flexibility and feedback mechanisms necessary for product development

**Squad**: Given a mission to manage and maintain it not a project.

## Impact

What tech companies value above all is impact—or tangible proof that what you
have done has in some way helped the customer.

## Squad

> It’s the company leader’s job to set the mission (the what). And it’s the
> squad’s job to come up with the solution (or the how).

> Project managers aren’t there, because there’s no project

> Scrum masters aren’t there because unicorns don’t do Scrum

> Product Manager OR Product Owner

- Define stategy
- Create roadmaps
- Feature definitions
- Forecasting

at the same time
