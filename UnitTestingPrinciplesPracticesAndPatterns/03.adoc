= Better testing

== Arrange step

* Use `make->x` function so you can share the arrange step across tests but parameterized to change the values for each usecase. 

[source,clojure]
----
(defn make-store [product quantity]
  (let [store (->Store)]
    (AddInventory store product quantity)
    store))

(fact "Purchase succeeds when enough inventory"
  (let [product Shampoo
        store (make-store product 10)
        customer (->Customer)
        response (purchase customer store product 5)]
    (response => true)
    (get-inventory store product) => 5))

(fact "Purchase fails when not enough inventory"
  (let [product Shampoo
        store (make-store product 10)
        customer (->Customer)
        response (purchase customer store product 15)]
    (response => false)
    (get-inventory store product) => 10))
----

== Naming Tests

* Write test scenario for non programmer (domain expert)
* Testing unit of behaviour
** Not testing specific implementation (IsDeliveryValid)

Bad::
`IsDeliveryValid InvalidDate Returns False`

Good::
`Delivery with invalid date is invalid`

== Triangultion

Use paramaterised tests for more test cases.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn make-date [amount] 
  (>> (now) (days amount))

(tabular
  (fact "Detect invalid delivery date"
    (valid-date (make-date ?days) => false
    ?days
    -1
    0
    1))

(fact "Earliest delivery date 2 days from now"
  (valid-date (make-date 2))) => true)
