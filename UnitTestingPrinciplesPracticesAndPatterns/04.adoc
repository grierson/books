= 4 pillars of good unit test

. Regressions
. Resistance to Refactor
. Fast feedback
. Maintainability

== Regressions

Needed to maintain growth of project.

* Making sure you don't break old stuff
* More LOC = More Bugs
* Test Domain logic more as it's more valuable
** Waste of time testing getters and setters

== Resistance to refactor
Use classical style testing

False positive :: 
Test fails even though implementation is correct

London style leads to false positives
* Loss of intrest/confidence it tests
*** Can't refactor code without breaking tests
*** Lose confidence in tests
**** So you don't run your tests
**** So you don't refactor
