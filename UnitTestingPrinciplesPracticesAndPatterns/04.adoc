= 4 pillars of good unit test

. Regressions
. Resistance to Refactor
. Fast feedback
. Maintainability

== Regressions

Needed to maintain growth of project.

* Amount of code being executed within test
* Complexity of code (Domain logic > boiler plate)
** More tests for domain logic than boiler plate

== Resistance to refactor
Use classical style testing

London style leads to
* Loss of intrest/confidence it tests
*** Can't refactor code without breaking tests
*** Lose confidence in tests
**** So you don't run your tests
**** So you don't refactor
