== What is a microservice

* Independently deployable services that are modeled around a business domain
** Encapsulates functionality and that are accessible to other services via a network
* Should have small external interfaces that rarely changes
** So implementation can change freely
** Consumers don't break
* Architecture
** Hexagonal/Ports and adapters/Onion/Clean
** Middle pure business logic
** Outside interfaces (APIS)

== Key concepts

* Independently deployable
** (Loosely coupled) Can release new/updated service without deploying other services
** Need explicit/strong/well-defined/stables contracts/interfaces between services to prevent breaking changes
* Modelled around a Business domain (DDD)
** Rolling out feature that requires changes to many services is costly
*** Need to coordinate the releases
* Prioritises high cohesion of business functionality over technical functionality
** Cohesion often refers to how the elements of a module belong together

* Don't share database
** If services share a database then they become coupled and changes need to coordinated between the two

* Size
** "Should be as big as your head" (What you find easily understood)
** As small an interface as possible

== Why

* Composability
** As services are small and focused they can be used in different business processes
* Scaling
** Can scale different parts of your infrastructure Ã€ la carte
*** Need 10 instances of `picture service` but only 2 of the `profile service`

== Essentials

* Log aggregation tool
** Collect and aggregates logs from all services
** Humio, Datadog
* Trace
** Jaeger, Lightstep, Honeycomb

== Takeaways

* Pros
** Scaling, can spin up more instances for a particular service
** 1 service can fail but entire system keeps running
* Cons
** Managing loads of services
** Deploying loads of services
** Learn loads of new tools for managing microservices
